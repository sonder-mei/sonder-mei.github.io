  abstract = {{Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy have improved patient outcomes, yet responses to immunotherapy remain moderate. We conducted a Phase II clinical trial (NCT04718415) involving 51 cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and applied single-cell RNA and T/BCR sequencing on tumor and blood samples to elucidate the immune cell perturbations. Our findings associate poor response with reduced levels of CCR7+CD4 Naïve T cells and CD27+ Memory B cells, as well as higher expression of immunosenescence-related genes in T and B cell subsets. Using naturally aged and Ercc1+/- transgenic aging mouse models, we found that senolytics enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in multiple solid tumors by mitigating tumor immunosenescence. Notably, we launched a Phase II clinical trial, COIS-01 (NCT05724329), which pioneers the combination of senolytics with anti-PD-1 therapy. The clinical results demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy is associated with a favorable safety profile and therapeutic efficacy, significantly mitigating adverse effects and alleviating immunosenescence. These findings underscore the pivotal role of immunosenescence characteristics in influencing the effectiveness of immunotherapy and suggest a promising therapeutic efficacy along with a beneficial safety assessment for the combination of senolytics with anti-PD-1 therapy.}},

  abstract = {{Recent interest in high-throughput recording of neuronal activity has motivated rapid improvements in genetically encoded calcium or voltage indicators (GECIs or GEVIs) for all-optical electrophysiology. Among these probes, the ASAPs, a series of voltage indicators based on a variant of circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) and a conjugated voltage sensitive domain (VSD), are capable of detecting both action potentials and subthreshold neuronal activities. Here we show that the ASAPs, when excited by blue light, undergo reversible photobleaching. We find that this fluorescence loss induced by excitation with 470-nm light can be substantially reversed by low-intensity 405-nm light. We demonstrate that 405-nm and 470-nm co-illumination significantly improved brightness and thereby signal-to-noise ratios during voltage imaging compared to 470-nm illumination alone. Illumination with a single wavelength of 440-nm light also produced similar improvements. We hypothesize that reversible photobleaching is related to cis-trans isomerization and protonation of the GFP chromophore of ASAP proteins. Amino acids that influence chromophore isomerization are potential targets of point mutations for future improvements.}},

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we delineated diverse genetically defined cell types in the LS that play distinct roles in reward processing. Notably, we found that estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing neurons in the ventral LS (LSEsr1) are key drivers of reward seeking via projections to the ventral tegmental area, and these neurons play an essential role in methamphetamine (METH) reward and METH-seeking behavior. Extended exposure to METH increases the excitability of LSEsr1 neurons by upregulating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, thereby contributing to METH-induced locomotor sensitization. These insights not only elucidate the intricate molecular, circuit, and functional architecture of the septal region in reward processing but also reveal a neural pathway critical for METH reward and behavioral sensitization.}},

However, the specific roles and synaptic transmissions of corticostriatal connection are less studied, especially the corticostriatal transmission from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Here, a direct glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission in the corticostriatal projection from the ACC is found. Kainate receptors (KAR)‐mediated synaptic transmission is increased in this corticostriatal connection both in vitro and in vivo seizure‐like activities. GluK1 containing KARs and downstream calcium‐stimulated adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1) are involved in the upregulation of KARs following seizure‐like activities. Inhibiting the activities of ACC or its corticostriatal connection significantly attenuated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)‐induced seizure. Additionally, injection of GluK1 receptor antagonist UBP310 or the AC1 inhibitor NB001 both show antiepileptic effects. The studies provide direct evidence that KARs are involved in seizure activity in the corticostriatal connection and the KAR‐AC1 signaling pathway is a potential novel antiepileptic strategy. This study found that there is a direct glutamatergic projection from the ACC to the dorsal striatum mediated by AMPA/KA receptors. KAR‐mediated EPSCs increased in the ACC‐striatum pathway following seizure‐like activity in both in vitro and in vivo seizure models. Inhibiting the projection of ACC to the striatum significantly attenuated PTZ‐induced seizure‐like activities. The KAR‐AC1 signaling pathway thus presents a potential antiepileptic target.}},

Less is known about the basic mechanism of this cortical-cortical connection and its functional importance. Here we investigate the cortical-cortical connection between the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) by using the classic electrophysiological and optogenetic approach. We find that there is a direct synaptic projection from one side ACC to the contralateral ACC. Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter for bilateral ACC connection, including projections to pyramidal cells in superficial (II/III) and deep (V/VI) layers of the ACC. Both AMPA and kainate receptors contribute to synaptic transmission. Repetitive stimulation of the projection also evoked postsynaptic Ca2+ influx in contralateral ACC pyramidal neurons. Behaviorally, light activation of the ACC-ACC connection facilitated behavioral withdrawal responses to mechanical stimuli and noxious heat. In an animal model of neuropathic pain, light inhibitory of ACC-ACC connection reduces both primary and secondary hyperalgesia. Our findings provide strong direct evidence for the excitatory or facilitatory contribution of ACC-ACC connection to pain perception, and this mechanism may provide therapeutic targets for future treatment of chronic pain and related emotional disorders. A combination of slice physiology, in vivo optogenetics, and behavioral analyses shows that the cortical-cortical connection between bilateral anterior cingulate cortex facilitates pain perception and enhanced anxiety-like behaviors associated with acute and chronic pain in adult mice.}},

Here, we investigated how ACh influences reverberatory activity in cultured neuronal networks. We found that ACh suppressed the occurrence of evoked reverberation at low to moderate doses, but to a much lesser extent at high doses. Moreover, high doses of ACh caused a longer duration of evoked reverberation, and a higher occurrence of spontaneous activity. With whole-cell recording from single neurons, we found that ACh inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) while elevating neuronal firing in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, all ACh-induced cellular and network changes were blocked by muscarinic, but not nicotinic receptor antagonists. With computational modeling, we found that simulated changes in EPSCs and the excitability of single cells mimicking the effects of ACh indeed modulated the evoked network reverberation similar to experimental observations. Thus, ACh modulates network dynamics in a biphasic fashion, probably by inhibiting excitatory synaptic transmission and facilitating neuronal excitability through muscarinic signaling pathways.}},

Reward consumption increases NAcLat activity but decreases NAcMed activity, albeit with high variability among neurons. The heterogeneity in reward encoding could be attributed to differences in their synaptic inputs and transcriptional profiles. Specific optogenetic activation of Nts-positive neurons in the NAcLat promotes positive reinforcement, while activation of Cartpt-positive neurons in the NAcMed induces behavior aversion.

Moreover, we explored potential multi-modal experimental designs by integrating additional modules for optogenetics, electrical stimulation or local field potential recordings. Overall, TINIscope represents a timely and indispensable tool for studying the brain-wide interregional coordination that underlies unrestrained behaviors.

  abstract = {{The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a heterogeneous midbrain structure involved in various brain functions, such as motor control, learning, reward, and sleep. Previous studies using conventional tracers have shown that the PPN receives extensive afferent inputs from various cortical areas. To examine how these cortical axons make collateral projections to other subcortical areas, we used a dual-viral injection strategy to sparsely label PPN-targeting cortical pyramidal neurons in CaMKIIα-Cre transgenic mice. Using a high-speed volumetric imaging with on-the-fly-scan and Readout (VISoR) technique, we visualized brain-wide axonal projections of individual PPN-targeting neurons from several cortical areas, including the prelimbic region (PL), anterior cingulate area (ACA) and secondary motor cortex (MOs). We found that each PPN-projecting neuron had a unique profile of collateralization, with some subcortical areas being preferential targets. In particular, PPN-projecting neurons from all three traced cortical areas exhibited common preferential collateralization to several nuclei, with most neurons targeting the striatum (STR), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and periaqueductal gray (PAG), and a substantial portion of neurons also targeting the zona incerta (ZI), median raphe nucleus (MRN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Meanwhile, very specific collateralization patterns were found for other nuclei, including the intermediate reticular nucleus (IRN), parvicellular reticular nucleus (PARN) and gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GRN), which receive collateral inputs almost exclusively from the MOs. These observations provide potential anatomical mechanisms for cortical neurons to coordinate the PPN with other subcortical areas in performing different physiological functions.}},

  abstract = {{The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key cortical region that plays an important role in pain perception and emotional functions. Previous studies of the ACC projections have been collected primarily from monkeys, rabbits and rats. Due to technological advances, such as gene manipulation, recent progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the ACC-related chronic pain and emotion is mainly obtained from adult mice. Few anatomic studies have examined the whole-brain projections of the ACC in adult mice. In the present study, we examined the continuous axonal outputs of the ACC in the whole brain of adult male mice. We used the virus anterograde tracing technique and an ultrahigh-speed imaging method of Volumetric Imaging with Synchronized on-the-fly-scan and Readout (VISoR). We created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of mouse brains. We found that the ACC projected ipsilaterally primarily to the caudate putamen (CPu), ventral thalamic nucleus, zona incerta (ZI), periaqueductal gray (PAG), superior colliculus (SC), interpolar spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5I), and dorsal medullary reticular nucleus (MdD). The ACC also projected to contralateral brain regions, including the ACC, reuniens thalamic nucleus (Re), PAG, Sp5I, and MdD. Our results provide a whole-brain mapping of efferent projections from the ACC in adult male mice, and these findings are critical for future studies of the molecular and synaptic mechanisms of the ACC and its related network in mouse models of brain diseases.}},

Here, we describe a new microscopy method of Volumetric Imaging with Synchronized on-the-fly-scan and Readout (VISoR) for high-throughput, high-quality brain mapping. Combining synchronized scanning beam illumination and oblique imaging over cleared tissue sections in smooth motion, the VISoR system effectively eliminates motion blur to obtain undistorted images. By continuously imaging moving samples without stopping, the system achieves high-speed 3D image acquisition of an entire mouse brain within 1.5 hours, at a resolution capable of visualizing synaptic spines. A pipeline is developed for sample preparation, imaging, 3D image reconstruction and quantification. Our approach is compatible with immunofluorescence methods, enabling flexible cell-type specific brain mapping and is readily scalable for large biological samples such as primate brains. Using this system, we examined behaviorally relevant whole-brain neuronal activation in 16 c-Fos-shEGFP mice under resting or forced swimming conditions. Our results indicate the involvement of multiple subcortical areas in stress response. Intriguingly, neuronal activation in these areas exhibits striking individual variability among different animals, suggesting the necessity of sufficient cohort size for such studies.}},

  abstract = {{Dropout has been proven to be an effective algorithm for training robust deep networks because of its ability to prevent overfitting by avoiding the co-adaptation of feature detectors. Current explanations of dropout include bagging, naive Bayes, regularization, and sex in evolution. According to the activation patterns of neurons in the human brain, when faced with different situations, the firing rates of neurons are random and continuous, not binary as current dropout does. Inspired by this phenomenon, we extend the traditional binary dropout to continuous dropout. On the one hand, continuous dropout is considerably closer to the activation characteristics of neurons in the human brain than traditional binary dropout. On the other hand, we demonstrate that continuous dropout has the property of avoiding the co-adaptation of feature detectors, which suggests that we can extract more independent feature detectors for model averaging in the test stage. We introduce the proposed continuous dropout to a feedforward neural network and comprehensively compare it with binary dropout, adaptive dropout, and DropConnect on Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research-10, Street View House Numbers, NORB, and ImageNet large scale visual recognition competition-12. Thorough experiments demonstrate that our method performs better in preventing the co-adaptation of feature detectors and improves test performance.}},

  abstract = {{During development both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulate synaptic efficacy, usually working in opposite directions in response to neuronal activity. Homeostatic plasticity has often been investigated by assaying changes in spontaneous synaptic transmission resulting from chronic circuit inactivation. However, effects of inactivation on evoked transmission have been less frequently reported. Importantly, contributions from the effects of circuit inactivation and reactivation on synaptic efficacy have not been individuated. Here we show for developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture that chronic inactivation with TTX results in increased mean amplitude of miniature synaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not evoked synaptic currents (eEPSCs). However, changes in quantal properties of transmission, partially reflected in mEPSCs, accurately predicted higher-order statistical properties of eEPSCs. The classical prediction of homeostasis – increased strength of evoked transmission – was realized after explicit circuit reactivation, in the form of cells’ pairwise connection probability. In contrast, distributions of eEPSC amplitudes for control and inactivated-then-reactivated groups matched throughout. Homeostatic up-regulation of evoked synaptic transmission in developing hippocampal neurons in primary culture requires both the inactivation and reactivation stages, leading to a net increase in functional circuit connectivity.}},
